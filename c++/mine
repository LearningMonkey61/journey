1. std::remove leveas unspecified data in the end, don't do anything with
   them, otherwise you should use std::partition.

2. std::min or std::max take const T& and return const T&, which means if you
   pass rvalue as arg, it's life time is bound to the argument, not the return
   one, it will be expired after min or max finished it's life time.

3. most algorithm take functor by value, don't use state in functor.

4. std::set_difference expect its input to be sorted,  it is possible to use it
   (or any algorithm on sorted elements) based on a comparator (letâ€™s call it C)
   different from the comparator used for sort, provided that the elements are also
   sorted by this comparator C. (C is less stricter than sort comparator).

5. the relative order of initialization of non-local static objects defined in
   different translation units is undefined
