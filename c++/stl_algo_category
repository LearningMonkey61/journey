    set_intersection                A ^ B
    set_union                       A V B
    set_symmetry_difference         (A - B) V (B - A)
    include                         if A include B
    merge                           c = A + B
    inplace_merge                   just like merge in merge sort

search: 14
    unsorted search: 10
        find[_if[_not]]
        count[_if[_not]]
        adjacent_find                first two consecutive identical item
        search                       find first of any item in a group
        find_end                     find last of any item in a group
        search_n                     first n censecutive identical items

    sorted search: 4
        binary_search
        lower bound                     first value no less than
        upper bound                     first value greater than
        equal range                     <lower_bound, upper_bound>

transform   you can transform yourself if you want

filling: 8
    fill[_n]                    operator=,   init n item with the same value,
    uninitialized_fill[_n]      copy constructor, similar to placement new, init
                                n item with the same value
    generate[_n]                use unary functor to init
    iota[_n]                    ++ init

minmax: 6
    min[_element]
    max[_element]
    minmax[_element]
    c++11 add new overload to min and max for location list
    max always return a if a and b are equivalent, use minmax if that's that
    what you want.
    min and max use const T& as argument, and return const T&, which means, if
    you pass temporary object as argument, it's life time will be extend to the
    life time as cosnt T& argument, which will end when the function returned,
    be very very careful about this.

sort: 7
    sort                        quick sort
    is_sorted                   
    stable_sort                 keep relative order of equivalent item
    partial_sort[_copy]
    is_sorted_until
    nth_element                 sort into less_than_nth + nth + greater than nth

    you can sort a subrange of a collection by using a combination of
    nth_element and partial-sort

    boost::spread_sort          combine radix and quick sort

partition: 5
    partition[_copy]            return partition point: end of elemnts that pass
                                predicate. The copy versoin use two output iter
                                to seperate true and false items.
    stable_partition            keep relative order
    is_partitioned
    partition_point             get partition point of partitioned

    gather:
         stable_partition on 0 to n with negated predicate, stable_partition on
         n to last with predicate

    boost::is_partitioned_until

accumulate

reorder: 7
    next_permutation            will cycle if meet end
    prev_premutatoin
    is_premutation
    rotate[_copy]               can be used to do slide
    reverse
    shuffle

moving range: 6
    copy[_n|_backward]              first output iter must not in the range of source
    move[_backward]                 move style copy, first output iter must not in range of source
    swap_range                      overlap not allowed

heap: 3
    push_heap                   pop up newly pushed elemnets
    pop_heap                    swap front and end, pop down end, must follow by a pop_back
    sort_heap                   n times pop_heap without pop_back

remove:
    std::remove                 note that the values of elements left at the end
                                of the range are unspecified
